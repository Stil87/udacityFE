            <h3>Emily Jean "Emma" Stone (born November 6, 1988) is an American actress. The recipient of numerous
                accolades, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award, she was the world's highest-paid actress
                in 2017. Stone has appeared in Forbes Celebrity 100 in 2013 and in 2017, she was featured by Time as one
                of the 100 most influential people in the world.

                Born and raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, Stone began acting as a child, in a theater production of The
                Wind in the Willows in 2000. As a teenager, she relocated to Los Angeles with her mother and made her
                television debut in In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004), a reality show that produced only an
                unsold pilot. After small television roles, she made her film debut in Superbad (2007), and received
                positive media attention for her role in Zombieland (2009). The 2010 teen comedy Easy A was Stone's
                first starring role, earning her nominations for the BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award
                for Best Actress. This breakthrough was followed with further success in the romantic comedy Crazy,
                Stupid, Love (2011) and the drama The Help (2011). </h3>

        <div id="blogText"><p id="blogPostText">bEmily Jean Stone was born on November 6, 1988, in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Krista Jean Stone
            (née Yeager), a homemaker, and Jeffrey Charles Stone, the founder and CEO of a general-contracting
            company.[1][2] Stone lived on the grounds of the Camelback Inn resort from the age of 12 to 15.[3][4] She
            has a younger brother, Spencer.[5] Her paternal grandfather, Conrad Ostberg Sten, was from a Swedish family
            that anglicized their surname to "Stone" when they immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island. She
            also has German, English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry.[6]
            Stone appeared in sixteen productions at Valley Youth Theatre.

            As an infant, Stone had baby colic and cried frequently; she consequently developed nodules and calluses on
            her vocal cords while she was a child.[7] Stone has described herself as having been "loud" and "bossy"
            while growing up.[8] She was educated at Sequoya Elementary School and attended Cocopah Middle School for
            the sixth grade. Although she did not like school, she has stated that her controlling nature meant that "I
            made sure I got all As".[9] Stone suffered panic attacks as a child,[10] which she says caused a decline in
            her social skills.[11] She underwent therapy but states that it was her participation in local theater plays
            that helped cure the attacks.[10]</p> </div>
